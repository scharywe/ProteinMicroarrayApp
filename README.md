## Installation

The package requires Bioconductor package EBImage, which should be installed
first via

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Install package BiocManager
if(!require(BiocManager)) install.packages("BiocManager")
## Use BiocManager to install EBImage
BiocManager::install("EBImage", update = FALSE)
```

Next, one can install package ProteinMicroarrayApp, where all remaining dependencies will
be installed automatically.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## Install package remotes
if(!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
## Install package ProteinMicroarrayApp
remotes::install_github("scharywe/ProteinMicroarrayApp", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Start App

```{r}
ProteinMicroarrayApp::run_app()
```


## Description
Image analysis (cropping, segmetation, thresholding, feature engineering) 
of images taken from protein microarrays, (soon: computation of linear calibration 
models, automatic report generation via rmarkdown) by means of a shiny app.
